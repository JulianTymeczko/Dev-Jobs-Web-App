## Dev-Jobs-Web-App

## Description

I developed the Dev Jobs Web App from scratch, transforming Figma designs into a pixel-perfect web application. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ViteJS, and ESLint to create a fully responsive site, 

ensuring a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. This application allows users to search and filter potential job opportunities effortlessly. Moreover, it offers in-depth job 

descriptions, including website links and requirements. Additionally, I implemented two dynamic color schemes, allowing users to choose their preferred visual style.
