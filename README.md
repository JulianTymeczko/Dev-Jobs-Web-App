## Dev-Jobs-Web-App

## Description

Created from scratch, this application turned Figma files into a pixel-perfect web application. Dev Jobs Web App is a fully responsive site

across all screen sizes such as mobile, tablet and desktop. This application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ViteJS, and ESLint.

It allows users to search and filter through potential job opportunities, while also allowing users to click on an individual job and see the

full description of that job including its website and other details like its requirements. This project also features 2 color schemes

that a user can switch between.
